          <p>
            My name is LaDella S. Jordan. I am a 22 year old aquarius born and
            raised in
            <i>sweet home Alabama</i>. I enjoy spending my time practicing code,
            watching netflix, and cuddling with my insanely adorable maltese
            named Princetonn. I recently graduated December 15, 2018 with my
            B.S.B.A in Information Systems with a concentration in Enterprise
            Data Management & Applications. I am currently working a retail job
            and an internship as a Website Design and Support personnel. Aside
            from that, I continue to do my own at home practice to get better at
            my craft. <br />
            <br />
            My dream is to be a program developer. I would love to create many
            websites and applications that people can find very enjoyable and/or
            useful. I find beauty in coding because you have complete control
            and creativity for what you form. I am starting to consider doing
            freelance work as I get better. My short time goal is to continue to
            teach myself so I can be an excellent IT professional. As I become
            more effecient with coding, I would like to begin learning and
            getting certifications in Security+, Azure, and Oracle. I have
            complete confidence that I will master IT development, management,
            and databases.

            In this role it is my responsibility to lead my team to success.
            Collectively, there are 4 GSA's and we work hard to ensure that we
